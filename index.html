The first day, May 22, is coordinated with the
Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System
<a href="https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Form:Annualmeeting2020">(CSDMS) Annual
Meeting</a> (May 20-21, 2020), which is also taking place online instead of
in Boulder.
<p>
<h2><font color="#7F0000">Presentations for Users on Friday, May 22</font></h2>
<p>
The workshtop will start with some
Zoom presentations to introduce some new features of GeoClaw and the related
software packages
ForestClaw and D-Claw.  These may be of interest to users or potential users
and all are welcome to listen in and join the discussions.
<p>
The schedule is below. To register for access to Zoom, please use
<a href="https://forms.gle/kV3mg5sUyZ6AvyCx6">this Google form</a>.
On the form you can also request a Zoom meeting with the
developers to discuss any problem you might be having, and/or express
interest in participating more broadly in the Developers' workshop.

<h3><font color="#7F0000">Getting started with GeoClaw</font></h3>
If you are not already a GeoClaw user, you might want to first watch this
<a
href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Presenters-0439&sa=D&ust=1589394725562000&usg=AFQjCNHUmSJtAp-wqRqlLNeY993_x5FHGw">introductory
video</a> from a recent CSDMS webinar.  
The <a href="http://www.clawpack.org/geoclaw.html">GeoClaw documentation </a>
contains a description of many features and examples. See also the 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/gallery/gallery/gallery_geoclaw.html">GeoClaw Gallery</a>.
The website
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/geoclaw/">www.geoclaw.org</a>
has links to some papers related to the development and/or use of
GeoClaw. (That page needs updating, many recent papers are not listed!)
<p>
GeoClaw is distributed as part of <a
href="http://www.clawpack.org/">Clawpack</a> (Conservation Laws Package)
and can be installed following 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/installing.html">these instructions</a>.
Alternatively, you can use Docker, for which we suggest the
<a
href="http://www.clawpack.org/docker_image.html#a-better-image-for-geoclaw-users">
better image for GeoClaw users</a> that is available on Dockerhub.
<p>
A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdTChaOnNuw">video</a>
illustrating how to use the Docker image for GeoClaw is now available
on the brand new 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxIdwWtDvUG_kdn-KiSVroQ/">Clawpack
youtube channel</a>.
With luck, videos of these workshop presentations may also appear 
there in the near future.
