If you are not already a GeoClaw user, you might want to first watch this

GeoClaw is distributed as part of <a
href="http://www.clawpack.org/">Clawpack</a> (Conservation Laws Package)
and can be installed following 
<a href="http://www.clawpack.org/installing.html">these instructions</a>
or you can also use Docker, for which we suggest the
<a
href="http://www.clawpack.org/docker_image.html#a-better-image-for-geoclaw-users">
better image for GeoClaw users</a> that is available on Dockerhub.
The website
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/clawpack/geoclaw/">www.geoclaw.org</a>
has links to some papers related to the development and/or use of
GeoClaw. (That page needs updating, many recent papers are not listed!)
