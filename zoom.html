<h2><font color="#7F0000">Guidelines for using Zoom for the presentations</font></h2>

Due to the large number of registrants, please follow these guidelines:
<ul>
<p>
<li>Please mute yourself when joining the session and stay muted
   unless you are asking a question.

<p>
<li> We will try to save time for a few questions at the end of
   each presentation, and then we have an hour scheduled for additional
   questions and general discussion at 12:00 MDT.  So please don't
   interupt the presentations with oral questions.

<p>
<li> When possible, type your question into the chat box on Zoom
   (while the presentation is going on if you want) so we can scan
   them and try to answer the ones of most general interest first,
   and get back to others privately later.

<p>
<li> You could also ask a question in the form of an 
   <a href="https://github.com/clawpack/geoclawdev-2020/issues">issue
   on the GitHub repository</a>
   that we'll be using specifically for this workshop,
   You can start making issues now if there are things you'd like
   us to discuss!

<p>
<li> If you want to ask a question or make some comments or
   suggestions during the open discussion, please do!  But when
   possible, particularly to start a new topic, use the "raise
   hand" feature you should see if you open the "participants" tab
   on Zoom, so we don't have lots of people trying to talk at once.
   We will try to moderate the discussion.

<p>
<li> In general it's best to turn your video off in the interest of
   bandwidth, so that the presentations come through well for
   everyone.  But feel free to turn it on during the discussion or
   when asking a question, or not if you prefer.

<p>
<li> We expect everyone to abide by the 
    <a href="https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">
   Clawpack Code of Conduct,</a> and interact in a respectful manner.

</ul>
